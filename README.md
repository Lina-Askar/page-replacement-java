# Page Replacement Algorithms â€“ Java Project

A simulation of three common page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, and Optimal. The program analyzes and compares their performance in terms of page faults.

## Features
- First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Algorithm
- Tracks page faults (with & without replacement)
- Determines the best-performing algorithm

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Collections (Queue, Stack, List)

## File
- `PageReplacementAlgorithms.java`: Full implementation of all algorithms with input and analysis

## How to Run
1. Open the file in any Java IDE
2. Compile and run the program
3. Enter:
   - Number of frames
   - 20 page references (one at a time)
4. Observe results for all 3 algorithms and the performance summary
